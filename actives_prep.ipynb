      "Biochemical Assay: A variety of Ras proteins may be inhibited by compounds of the present invention (e.g., K-Ras, N-Ras, H-Ras, and mutants thereof at positions 12, 13 and 61, such as G12C, G12D, G12V, G12S, G13C, G13D, and Q61L, and others described herein). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to measure the ability of test compounds to covalently label nucleotide-loaded K-Ras isoforms. In assay buffer containing 12.5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM BME, 5 uM Cyclophilin A and 2 uM test compound, a 5 uM stock of GMP-PNP-loaded K-Ras (1-169) G12C is diluted 10-fold to yield a final concentration of 0.5 uM; with final sample volume being 100 uL. The sample is incubated at 25�� C. for a time period of up to 24 hours prior to quenching by the addition of 10 uL of 5% Formic Acid. Quenched samples are centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 minutes in a benchtop centrifuge before injecting a 10 uL aliquot onto a reverse phase C4 column and eluting into the mass spectrometer with an increasing acetonitrile gradient in the mobile phase. Analysis of raw data may be carried out using Waters MassLynx MS software, with % bound calculated from the deconvoluted protein peaks for labeled and unlabeled K-Ras.\n"
