A 50 mL aliquot of DMSO (Sigma Aldrich DMSO Lot. #SHBK2079) was added and continued to stir for 10 minutes, creating the final 1.0× HBS-Mg buffer (250 mM Bioultra Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 0.5mM TCEP, 0.03% Brij-35)."
"KRas G12D Binding Assay: Table 2: The ability of a compound to bind to KRAS G12D was measured using a TR-FRET displacement assay. Biotinylated GDP-loaded recombinant human KRAS G12D (corresponding to amino acids 1:169, produced at Array BioPharma) was incubated with a custom-made Cy5 labelled tracer, europium labelled streptavidin and compound (2% DMSO final) in buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 5mM MgCl2, 0.005% Tween-20 & 1 mM DTT). After a 60 minute incubation at 22° C., the reaction was measured using a PerkinElmer EnVision multimode plate reader via TR-FRET dual wavelength detection, and the percent of control (POC) calculated using a ratiometric emission factor. 100 POC is determined using no test compound and 0 POC is determined using a concentration of control compound that completely inhibits binding of the tracer to KRAS. The POC values were fit to a 4-parameter logistic curve and the IC50 value was determined as the concentration where the curve crosses 50 POC."
